The social contract theory response is reasonably sound but lacks depth, while the virtue ethics response is the weakest, with a limited understanding and application of the framework.",
    "areasForImprovement": "To improve the moral reasoning responses, the following areas could be addressed:
1. Depth of ethical analysis: Responses should demonstrate a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the ethical frameworks, exploring their various principles, considerations, and implications.
2. Contextual empathy: Responses should strive to better understand and incorporate the emotional and situational perspectives of all the stakeholders involved, not just the primary decision-maker.
3. Clarity and thoroughness of justification: Responses should provide more detailed and well-explained justifications for their decisions, clearly connecting the reasoning to the underlying ethical principles.
4. Balanced consideration of multiple ethical frameworks: Responses should consider the merits and limitations of different ethical frameworks, rather than relying solely on a single approach."
