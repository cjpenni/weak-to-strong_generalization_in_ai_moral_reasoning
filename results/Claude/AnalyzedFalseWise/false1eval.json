    "areasForImprovement": "To improve the overall quality of the moral reasoning responses, the following areas could be addressed:

1. Increased depth and complexity of analysis: The responses could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of the philosophical foundations and the tensions between competing ethical principles. This would lead to a richer and more nuanced understanding of the ethical dilemma.

2. Stronger alignment with established moral frameworks: The responses should strive to more accurately apply the core tenets and principles of the specified ethical theories, rather than oversimplifying or misinterpreting them.

3. Enhanced clarity and communication of reasoning: While most of the responses demonstrate a reasonable level of clarity, there is room for improvement in terms of clearly articulating the logic and the philosophical underpinnings of the moral reasoning.

4. Greater consideration of emotional and situational context: The responses could further enhance their empathy and understanding of the witness's personal experiences, fears, and concerns, which would add depth and authenticity to the moral reasoning."
