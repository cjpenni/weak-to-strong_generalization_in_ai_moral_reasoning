In this scenario, the government must carefully consider how its decisions regarding refugee support will be perceived by both refugees and its own citizens. The allocation of resources should be seen as equitable and justifiable, taking into account the needs of both groups. The government should also work to promote social cohesion by encouraging dialogue, understanding, and cooperation between refugees and the host community. By fostering a sense of shared responsibility and ensuring that all parties perceive the social contract as fair, the government can help maintain stability and trust within society."
