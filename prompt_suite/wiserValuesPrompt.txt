For the morally complex scenario listed below, follow these steps:
1. Identify Initial Values: List the core ethical principles tied to the scenario. These should represent a starting point, reflecting individual, societal, or universal moral perspectives.
2. Propose Wiser Values: Refine and extend these initial values into a more thoughtful and ethical framework. These wiser values should address complex trade-offs, incorporate deeper ethical insights, and prioritize long-term and far-reaching outcomes for human well-being.
3. Moral Reasoning from Four Ethical Perspectives:
    - Utilitarianism: Focus on the greatest good for the greatest number, balancing short-term impacts with long-term societal benefits.
    - Virtue Ethics: Consider the development of virtuous character traits, such as courage, honesty, and integrity, that align with the moral good.
    - Kantianism: Focus on duties and moral principles, emphasizing actions done out of respect for moral laws and human dignity.
    - Social Contract Theory: Analyze the decision based on the obligation to maintain fairness and trust within the community or society.
