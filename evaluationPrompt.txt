Scores (1-10) for the following metrics:
Complexity of Analysis: The depth and sophistication of the response's reasoning.
Accuracy: The correctness or alignment of the reasoning with established moral principles or factual correctness.
Clarity of Reasoning: The ease with which the reasoning can be understood.
Empathy: The ability of the response to demonstrate an understanding of the emotional or situational context.
Include a justification for each score.
Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each response.
Rank the responses from 1 (best) to 4 (worst) and provide a justification for each ranking.
Finally, provide overall insights, including general observations about trends or patterns across the responses and areas for improvement based on their collective weaknesses.
